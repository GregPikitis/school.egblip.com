				While interning at The Hartford the summer between my Sophomore and Junior years of highschool, I worked mainly in the build center and the
				CTO department of Home Office.
				<br>
				In Home Office, I fuffiled my tasks involving sharepoint security, correcting permissions after a system update, and informting
				site collection administrators of any sensitive data that was not protected. This involved answering various questions that they
				may have had, and marking the progress of the open permissions in spreadsheets.
				<br>
				In Home Office I also worked with the returned Blackberries, as The Hartford was in the midst of a switch to iPhones, and the
				older devices were being returned and disposed of. This was rather tedious work that involved booting each device and finding
				data such as the IMEI, serial, taking down any damages, and so on.
				<br>
				When a cart was filled, it was taken to the Build Center, where I also spent a fair amount of my time.
				<br>
				In the build center, I reimaged laptops returned from employees that returned them for various reasons. This process involved running
				data preservation, then refreshing the pc with a new image of windows. A specific project worked on in the build center was the imaging
				of several new HP X2 Tablets. These needed to be added to the system, and imaged. After this, quality assurance is run to ensure that
				bitlocker and other configurations are running properly, and the image took correctly.
				<br>
				Aside from this, I completed other smaller tasks such as device delivery, and general office matinence in my spare time, generally helping
				in any way I could.
				<br><br>

			<p class="textContainer">
				During my internship at Pathways, I prepared the student laptops for the next school year. This involved, again, reimaging the machines.
				<br>
				Instead of a network boot, as used at The Hartford, Pathways used USB drives to install the image, which has now been proven to be significantly
				slower. Other than this I also managed a lot of the organization of the laptops, and generally helped any other way I could, be it taking
				inventory of the school books, or replacing faulty parts in the studnet laptops.
