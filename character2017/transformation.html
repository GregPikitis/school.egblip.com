				In "Sunday in the Park", a Mother and Father were with their toddler at the park. Focusing on the wife, or mother, in the beginning she was happy
				and pleased as it was a nice day, but after events change her mood, the day is no longer seen the same.
				<br>
				Her mood is transformed and illustrated in the crests above.

				Transformation is seen here in that when the gene is mutated, it changes the effect and function of proteins.
				<br>
				von Willebrand Disease is used as the example in this project. Upon normal function, it assists in the clotting of blood.
				Reduction of this could cause slower clotting, or a lack of clotting, and result in prolonged bleeding from minor cuts, heavy bruising, large nose bleeds, etc.
				<br>
				If a mutation occured in the von Willebrand gene when it was assembled, the gene would code for different amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Because
				proteins are three dimentional, and the shape is due to the interactions between the amino acids, changing one would cause the shape to alter. This <b>could</b>
				effect the function of the protein, causing it to either not be as efficient, not work at all, or even possibly work better. It could also not effect the function
				at all, this is possible if the amino acid that was changed is of the same type as was intended, causing no change in the shape of the protein.
