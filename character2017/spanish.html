				<b>David the Doctor</b>
				<br>
				For my character analysis, my group and I focused on David, a doctor who Toni met while
				working to be a nun. He left the monastary to marry her. Though this was controversial,
				David and Toni were happy with their decision and later worked to prevent people from
				being treated unfairly.
				<br><br>
				For the physical aspect of the project, we created a poster with a drawing of David on it, and chose quotes that
				we felt demonstrated his character. We wrote these quotes next to the body part that
				associated with them, in English and in Spanish. We presented this poster infront of the
				class.
