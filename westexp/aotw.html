			In 1862, in an attempt to populate the west, the government offered vast amounts of land for a very low price to those that applied. This was called the Homestead Act, and allowed blacks, women, immigrants, and others who were not traditionally allowed to own land, to do so west of the Mississippi. This act did as it was intended, and people took advantage of the opportunity and started to occupy the land in the west. Some to simply start a new life for them and their family, some to attempt to strike gold and become rich, as land in places such as California and Oregon were rumored to have large amounts of gold. This trip to the new land was made simple by the railroad that ran across the continent. This railroad caused more people to travel to the west, and caused towns to appear around it. This civilization brought more and more people to the west, increasing the appeal and population.
