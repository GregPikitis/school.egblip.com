			Manifest Destiny was a period in the 19th century where it was believed that The United States should expand throughout North America.  With the purchase of the Louisiana Territory this became a more insight goal, and the government at the time created the Homestead Act, which allowed people to apply for land in the new territory for very cheap or sometimes even free. This act was not only open to whites though, minorities such as women, blacks, and immigrants were allowed to apply as well. The expansion was made more accessible with the creation of the railroad and the excessive use of the tracks. This also caused difficulties, as the land was inhabited with Native Americans that were accustom to their way of life.
