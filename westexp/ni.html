			The expansion to the west may have been a success to the white settlers, but these changes negatively impacted their native neighbors. The Native Americans living in the western portion of America felt the heavy effects of the whites presence.  A plains tribe, the Pawnee, relied on the hunt for the native buffalo in the area to survive. With the coming of settlers from the east, the buffalo population decreased significantly. White hunters made sport out of killing the animals, leaving the Pawnee with a lacking food source. Not only this, but the railroad that was placed through the lands drove the animals away, by expanding to the west, the settlers destroyed the livelihood of the residence already occupying the land, causing them to leave their lands and seek out new ones. The Pawnee, due to the lack of food and their disputes with other native tribes, took residence in Kansas. Not only where the Pawnee affected, tribes such as the Choctaw were forced from their native lands and required to move to the west where land was disignated for them. While traveling to their new land, an estimated 1000 mile journey, the natives were treated like prisoners, many not making the journey. Out of the 16,000 Choctaw, 5,000 to 6,000 died while on the trail.
