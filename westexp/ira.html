			The Indian Removal Act of was signed in by Andrew Jackson in 1830. This act allowed Jackson to force natives from their land in the east, and move them to designated land in the west. This was supported at the time as the natives were viewed as savage and dangerous to families. Jackson was praised for acting as a protector for his country. The treaties created with the native chiefs, were intended to be signed by native chiefs out of free will, though the tribes were often very pressured or threatened into agreeing to the transfer to the west. One example of the force used on the natives was in The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. During this negotiation, the natives were put under the threat of strict law enforcement. One source phrased this as to “feel the weight of state law”. Though there were natives that attempted to rebel or conform to the white man’s ways, the majority left the 10 acres of land they gave up, and made the journey to the west.
