			<p>"You see I was up all night doing work for Stroop and I just wanted to take a little nap this morning but time got away from me and I got here as fast as I could and I just really want to do well I'm sorry!"</br>Mr. Vargas looks at you funny and says "We are doing the article. Test will start after we discuss it." You sigh in relief and feel a little embarrassed for not assessing the situation before talking at him. You sit down and wait for the test. When it comes, you realize that it requires the use of a computer, <i>damn</i>, you forgot that in the car in your rush to get to class on time. Because of this poor mistake you are required to use Mr. Vargas' classroom laptops. You become frustrated with how terrible it is and out of anger, throw it across the room. It happens to hit another student in the knee, shattering all of the bones there. He will never walk again and your test is disqualified as the throw broke the laptop. Sadly, you recieved a grade of 0 and your parents killed you. RIP. </p>
