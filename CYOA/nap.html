			<p>After experiencing one of those terrible dreams where you feel like falling, you jump awake. After adjusting after that horrible experience, you notice that the clock is now displaying 8:00!! You're Late! </br>You grab your stuff and run into the building, when you make it to Vargas' classroom you are red, sweaty, and anxious. He looks at you with surprise, "Why are you late!!??". You freeze. Telling him the truth would not sound good, though making something up could be worse on the spot... You're worried that he won't let you take the test...</p>
