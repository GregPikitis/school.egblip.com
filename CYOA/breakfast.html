			<p>You make it to the test perfectly on time, and even had time to almost enjoy a school breakfast. Now is time for your next classes. You know you will walk by your locker on the way there and have been carrying around your skateboard from the morning. Though you will need to get it at the end of the day, it'll make your load smaller and none of the teachers will give you weird looks. </p>
