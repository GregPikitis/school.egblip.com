			<p>You succeed in finding your friends locker and go to the bathroom to apply her makeup. Somehow, these events lead to much more lateness than would be expected of just transit time.

This cruel punishment results in a plumet in your self esteem, and you resort to killing yourself, because how could you live with this guilt?</p>
