			<p>You move on with your day and eat the school lunch. You weren't feeling so hot after eating the breakfast lump but this lunch seemed to negate the effects, you're just glad you felt fine during the test. Perhaps your stomach was lowering its standards and how the school food was fine. You are glad you got to class on time, other students got in late and were assigned lunch detention! On the way home from school, unfortunatly on the way home you are hit by a car and die. No one is very sad, you were kind of a meh person. Sorry.</p>
