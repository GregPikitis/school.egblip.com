		<h3>Made by Emelia Blankenship</h3>
		
		<div class="story">
			<p>You continue to move towards your class, dismissing the ominous figure as some kid, or perhaps your imagination. When you get to class, you seat yourself and are prepared to learn, bright eyed and bushy tailed, though a few moments later a figure you recognize as the creepy shadow reveals themselves in the doorway. </br>It was Mr. Martin, and he looks angry. You figure a real Pathways Hooligan was up to something, but are sadly mistaken. He approaches you, "You gonna put that skateboard in your locker?"</p>
