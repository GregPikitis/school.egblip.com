			<p>You get up and put the skateboard in your locker. You find that it is easier to follow rules that don't matter much and are even kind of glad that you don't need to carry it around anymore. Once you get back to class, he praises you for your agreeability and you continue on your highschool career without trouble, until finally you become wildly successful and are able to sue the school for harrassment. You win and become loaded with money, which you enjoy. Congrats.</p>
