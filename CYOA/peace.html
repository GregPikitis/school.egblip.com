			<p>You decide you can live with this and know the school has fixed their lunches. You have grown a pig snout due to the side effects of the disease. You think it sort of suits you. </br>Someone else thinks so too. He has a surising attraction for you and you marry within months. He loves you. You have piggy children together and live happily until 2050, the year of the worldwide bacon shortage. People get desperate.</p>
