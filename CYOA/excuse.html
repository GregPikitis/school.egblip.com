			<p>You take a shot in the dark and come up with a lie, right there, on the spot. This isn't something you're good at but you're feeling like you can produce something good this time. You go for it.</br>"M-M-My dog ate it..."</br><i>Perfect</i>, you give yourself a mini pat on the back for how smooth you rolled that one out and looked up at Mr. Vargas expecting sympathy and accomadations.</br>"Ate what?" He says</br>You stare at him wide eyed, <i>Oh. Right.</i> You chuckle a bit.</br>"Got youuu........."</br>He tells you to sit down after awkwardly chuckling with you and you do so. It turned out that you got to class during the article and were not late after all. After this is calmed down, you realize that the world is a good place, and all stress is taken off of your shoulders. You ace your test and do wonderfully in life.</p>
