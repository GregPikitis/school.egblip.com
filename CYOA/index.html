			<p>After a long night of finishing homework for Mr. Stroop, you wake up to find that you are extremely tired. This is no surprise, you knew it was coming but you are still dismayed by this overwhelming urge to roll over and let yourself fall back asleep. You power through though, you have a test today in Mr. Vargas' class. In order to maintain your GPA you cannot get a bad grade!! You pull yourself through the morning routine and drive to school. You are pleasantly surprised when you get there 10 minutes early. You have the brilliant idea to take a small nap in the car, a small snooze could really help during your classes. The sound of the bell will be loud enough to wake you. Of course, if you went in now you could have a semi-decent breakfast...</p>
