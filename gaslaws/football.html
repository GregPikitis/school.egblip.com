				The football is pumped full of air while in a warm room, and taken outdoors in a cold climate.

			<p class="textContainer">
				A football shrinks when it gets cold because the air insides’ temperature 
				is decreasing, causing the volume of the air inside to also decrease, 
				making the ball shrink. This is confirmed by the Charles’s Gas Law. As the temperature of a gas
				decreases, as does the volume. For more information, see <a href="charles.html"><u>Charles's Law</u></a>.
