				Tires lose air prsessure more often in the winter than the summer because the cold weather causes the pressure to lower.
			</div>
			<p class="textContainer">
				The air in tires needs to be refilled more often when it’s cold 
				because as the temperature decreases, as does the volume of
				the air inside the tire. This causes the tire become flat and in need of refilling.
				This is confirmed by the Charles’s Gas Law, stating that as the temperature of a gas decreases, as
				does the volume. For more informatoin, see <a href="charles.html"><u>Charles's Law</u></a>.
